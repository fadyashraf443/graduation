## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated electric blue (#63B5FF) to reflect the digital and cybersecurity focus of the application. The vibe is modern, techy, and high-energy, but not literally 'cyberpunk'.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF).
- Accent color: A contrasting but harmonious purple (#A080FF) to add visual interest and highlight interactive elements. This will contrast nicely with the electric blue.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, as it has a modern and tech-oriented aesthetic that complements the theme. 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to keep things easily readable. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use security-themed icons in a flat style with neon accents, to create a clean, crisp interface and maintain brand consistency. Consider representing the Red team with red icons, the Blue team with blue icons, and the Purple team with purple icons.
- Incorporate glassmorphism cards and translucent elements, with an intuitive navigation using breadcrumbs. Use responsive grid system that renders appropriately on all devices.
- Apply subtle animated transitions and micro-interactions when loading new data and on user interactions.
